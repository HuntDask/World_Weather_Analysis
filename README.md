# World_Weather_Analysis
 ## Overview
For our project we were able to look at PlanMyTrip app and make adjustments for a better overall application development. W used Google Maps API, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook to examine the app and make adjustments with specifacally longitude/latitude, weather forcasts, hotel locations, average min/max temperatures, and more to bring our PlanMyTrip app to the next level.
## Personal Planned Trip Using PlanMyTrip
For my personal trip, I choose to begin and end in Portland my hometown. We would then travel to Laguna, Half Moon Bay, and Cabo San Lucas. From our API and Jupyter Notebook analysis, we were able to plot out our trip accordingly with all the necessities we needed such as weather, hotel location, and specfic country. From these charts and visual figures, we can see how we used our API/Jupyter Notebook coding in order to plan our trip to different cities perfectly.
